Trees are a data structure that have a hierarchical structure, can have multiple child nodes.

Trees have:

- parent - child relationship
- and leaf at the end of the tree
- can have subtrees (like the circle one in photo)
- nodes - like a linked list

Examples: 

- HTML structure is a tree

If you played chess online versus a computer, in the era when was not machine learning, the algorithm was a tree.
