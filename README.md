## Interview - How to solve problems 

1. **Analytic Skills** - How can you think through problems and analyze things?
2. **Coding Skills** - Do you code well, by writing clean, simple, organized, readable code?
3. **Tehnical Skills** - Do you know the fundamentals of the job you're applying for?
4. **Communication Skills** - Does your personality match the companiesâ€™ culture?

### Data Structures 
- **Arrays**
- Staks 
- Queues
- Linked Lists 
- Trees 
- Tries
- Graphs 
- **Hash Tables**

### Algorithms 
- Sorting
- Dynamic Programming 
- BFS + DFS (Searching)
- Recursion
  
## Quick Notes

When you are askend in an interview about strings, you should be thinking like is an array. For example: when you are asked to reverse a string, convert the string into an array (with split() in javascript), do the operations, and then convet back to string.

Common Interview Question - How to manipulate a string 

## [Javascript/ Typescript basic: Var vs Let vs Const](https://dev.to/sethusenthil/var-vs-let-vs-const-1cgc)

**Var** - have function scope - the variable's value can be accessed outside the if statement.

**Hoisting** - it tries to bring any sort of declaration (including named functions)on the topmost scope as possible

Since Vars use function scope, it brings it to the first line of the function. Keep in mind the Var is just being declared, not being assigned a value. That's why we are getting the string 'undefined' instead of 'error:var i is not defined'. 

**Let**- use block scope

**Block scope** means that it can only be used within the whatever is being declared a.k.a the block

Let's (pun intended) take us old example and replace it with let:

As runkit suggests, i can only be accessed in the if statement after the line of the declaration. Hoisting has no power when we declare statements with let.

**Const** - uses block scope, so it has all the properties of let besides the ability to prevent redeclaration of the variable

As you can see above, there are a few exceptions. If you have declared a string or a number the value can't be changed either. But when you are declaring as an object, it gets a bit interesting.

Message's properties can be modified, or added but message cannot be redeclared into a integer with a value of 100.

## Javascript/ Typescript Notes

[**Spread Operator** [...value]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-spread-operator-in-typescript/)- is a powerful tool, that allows you to spread the elements of an array or objects into another array or objects. This operator makes it easy to copy arrays, combine arrays, or create shallow copies of iterable.
