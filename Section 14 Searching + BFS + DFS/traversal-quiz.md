1. If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS
2. If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS
3. If the tree is very wide: DFS
4. If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS
5. Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS
6. Finding the shortest path: BFS
